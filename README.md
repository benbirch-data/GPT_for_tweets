# GPT_for_tweets

The jupyter notebook “congress and twitter merging.ipynb” contains code for replicating the datasets used for key word matching and accounts from which tweets are scraped ("congress117_condensed.csv", "all twitter profiles.csv") which are also available. 

4 files are needed in advance before using any of the code in “congress and twitter merging.ipynb”, which I have also uploaded:
